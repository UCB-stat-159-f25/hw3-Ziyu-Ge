# Homework 3 — From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part II

This project builds on the LIGO Open Science data analysis tutorial, focusing on the detection of binary black hole signals from the event **GW150914** using open LIGO data.

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Convert the original Jupyter notebook (`LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb`) into a **reproducible research package** following best software practices.
- Separate reusable Python code into a dedicated module (`ligotools`).
- Implement and test key functions (`loaddata`, `whiten`, `reqshift`, `write_wavfile`).
- Build a **MyST website** that hosts the notebook and documentation, including a Binder launch link for interactive use.
